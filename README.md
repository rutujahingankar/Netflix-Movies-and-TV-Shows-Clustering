Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering
# ðŸ“– Introduction
This project aims to cluster the video content available on Netflix based on the companyâ€™s site data. Apart from aiding in the development of an efficient recommendation system, clustering the video content would also provide information about the type of content the company is interested in listing on its site. Thus giving an insight to content creators and filmmakers on the type of video content in demand.
# 2. EDA Summary:
The notable observations identified during EDA were:

Most movies streaming on the platform were released after 2010. A large portion of the TV Shows streaming on the platform was released after 2015. The year 2017 had the highest number of movie and TV show releases on the platform. Netflix began adding videos to the platform in 2008 and started aggressively adding video content in 2017.
It was also found that more stand-alone movies were added as compared to TV shows. The majority of the content is rated for Mature Audiences and for audiences over 14 years old.
Drama is the most produced genre in the top non-English speaking countries with exception of Japan and South Korea. Japan is the biggest producer of Anime across the platform which is also the leading genre in Japan. Romance is the most produced genre in South Korea.
It is noted that Comedy was the most produced genre in English-speaking countries like the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada. Documentaries are predominantly produced in the United Kingdom and the United States of America
Duplicates of TV shows were made corresponding to their seasons. Upon doing so, it was observed that the TV shows signed have been higher than the movies in 2016
Although, the movies signed have been higher than TV shows ever since it was prominent that the TV shows signed per year were catching up to the movies signed annually. Hence, we can conclude that it was true that Netflix had been showing more interest in TV shows as compared to movies

Conclusion
In conclusion, tailored recommendations can be made based on information about movies and TV shows. In addition, similar models can be developed to provide valuable recommendations to consumers in other domains. It will solve for improved movie and TV-Show selection times with a considerable growth in satisfaction of the content being consumed leading to more user engagement and greater trust in Netflix recommendations.
